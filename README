runModel has the main String args and initialises the Population class which runs everything.

Population creates a collection of People objects (with subclasses Infant, Child, Adult and Pensioner, but these do little)
People are placed into Households using  a really tortured algorithm
People are also assigned to membership of different CommunalPlaces (which has many subclasses - School, Shop, etc, and many more to add, but the subclasses do little just now).
The final class is Covid is assigned to a People when they become infected in the model and deals with the kinetics of the infection in the person.

Currently I force infection upon 10 random people in the simulated populaiton of 10,000 among 3,000 Huseholds to start things off

Then in one hour timesteps the Population cycles through households and transmits infection (if relevant) and moves people to Communal Places. People in the Communal Places are also cycled through to transmit infection and move them home if needed.
